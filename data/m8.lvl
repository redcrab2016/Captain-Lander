Good landing Captain !

Since you've been detected by the
Energy Sucker our long range
radar has plotted a new approaching
Energy Sucker armada.

Our engineers failed to find out
a way to destroy them directly.

The only way to defend yourself
is to avoid them.

Speed is your only weapon !

Now your target is to find 
the surface energy switch.

Good luck !
